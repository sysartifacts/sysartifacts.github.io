# Artifact Review Summary: Paper [TITLE]

## Description of the Artifact

*Start by including the links and any other useful description (not instructions) provided by the authors, then summarize the reviewers' artifact descriptions*

## Envrionment(s) Used for Testing

*Describe the environments the evaluators used. If multiple environments were used succesfully, list all of them. Describe the environment in sufficient detail that a later reader could conceivably re-create something similar. If author-provided resources were used, say as much about them as we know (but don't provide hostnames, etc.)*

## Step-By-Step Instructions to Excercise the Artifact

*Describe what the evaluators did in a step-by-step manner to build, install, run, etc. Ideally, assuming the reviews contain enough detail, a later reader should be able to try to re-trace the evaluators' steps. Specific command lines, if they can be found in the authors' instructions, reviews, or comments, are encouraged. If multiple environments were used, and these require different steps, you may need to make notes about the differences.*

## How The Artifact Supports The Paper

*This is the summary of why we chose to award the badges we did: If we called it Functional, what, specifically did we run? If we called it Reproduced, what specifically, did we reproduce (eg. what experiments and/or figures)? Why did we consdier this sufficient to award the badge (eg. if we did not reproduce all figures, why were the ones we did run enough)? Badges that we did not award do not need to be discussed. Stick to the facts rather than opinions as much as possible.*

## Additional Notes and Resources

*If there are any other notes of interest that came up in the reviews or discussions that you think would be interesting to a future user of the artifact, you can include them here. This is also a good place to include links to other things that might be relevant to using this artifact.*
