## Call for Self-Nominations

*Self-Nomination Form: [https://forms.gle/q8aVja3LEmes8qNEA](https://forms.gle/q8aVja3LEmes8qNEA) - Due August 6*

SOSP 21 will be organizing an artifact evaluation process. More details can be found in the [call for artifacts](call.html). We are seeking senior graduate students, postdocs, and early-career researchers to join the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). As a committee member, you evaluate artifacts of accepted papers, determining how well each artifact supports its paper and give feedback to its authors. Finally, you will help to decide which papers will receive badges.

We expect each AEC member will evaluate 2–4 artifacts of accepted papers and that each evaluation will take about 10–20 hours. AEC members “bid” on artifacts in the second half of August. The main evaluation period runs from late August to late September. Nominees should make sure that they have enough time and availability for the AEC during all of these timeframes.

If you are interested in becoming a part of the Artifact Evaluation Committee, please fill out the form at [https://forms.gle/q8aVja3LEmes8qNEA](https://forms.gle/q8aVja3LEmes8qNEA). For any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the organizing chairs at [sosp21-aec-chairs@mpi-sws.org](mailto:sosp21-aec-chairs@mpi-sws.org). We encourage you to pass this form on to any others you think may be interested in participating!

The deadline to send in completed applications is August 6.
