Submitted artifacts can select to be evaluated against the following badges, which are defined in the [ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy v1.1](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)

| Badge | Description |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| <img src="/images/acm_available_1.1.png" alt="Artifacts Available (V1.1)" width="150px"> | Author-created artifacts relevant to this paper have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.  |
| <img src="/images/acm_functional_1.1.png" alt="Artifacts Evaluated - Functional (V1.1)" width="150px"> | The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation. |
| <img src="/images/acm_reproduced_1.1.png" alt="Results Reproduced (V1.1)" width="150px"> | The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author. |

In addition, the AEC may chose to award the "Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable" badge to artifacts submitted for evaluation for the "Artifacts Evaluated - Functional" - this will be done for artifacts that exceed the standards for the "Functional" level: "they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated".
