title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0
---

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself:
software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs,
models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as
important as that of the document itself, yet many of our conferences offer no formal means to
submit and evaluate anything but the paper itself. To address this shortcoming, this year OSDI will
run an optional artifact evaluation process for the first time.
