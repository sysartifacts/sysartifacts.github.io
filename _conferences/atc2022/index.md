A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond
the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw
survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on.
In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the
document itself. Last year, 84% of accepted OSDI papers participated in the
artifact evaluation process. Based on the success of the OSDI '21 Artifact Evaluation
last year, this year USENIX ATC will run an optional artifact evaluation process for the first time, in combination with OSDI.
