order: 20
---

Join the Artifact Evaluation committee, learn about the latest research before everyone else, and help make science more reusable and reproducible!

**Apply now** via the [online self-nomination form link](https://forms.gle/SBCNSih3exdU7q1X7) (deadline: **August 1, 2025, Anywhere on Earth**).

You can be located anywhere in the world as all committee discussions will happen online.
AEC membership is especially suitable if you are early in your career, such as the first or second year of your PhD.
You are welcome to join the AEC if you are working in a topic area covered by the conference such as
operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, and other areas of computer systems research.

As an artifact evaluator, you will:
- Read the papers whose artifacts you are assigned to review
- Install, audit, and run artifacts
- Discuss with other evaluators to award [badges](./badges)

Check out the [evaluator guide](/evaluator-guide) for an overview of what artifact evaluation involves.
You must carry out evaluations independently, without sharing data nor information with people outside the committee.

Please ensure you have available time during the evaluation period stated in the [home page](./index)'s important dates section.
We hope to assign 2 artifacts per evaluator, each taking around 5h to review.

This work can usually be done on your own computer, any moderately recent desktop or laptop will do.
In specific cases and to the extent possible, authors will arrange their artifacts so as to run in community research testbeds or will provide remote access to their systems.
If you have access to special hardware, that might come in handy, but it is by no means required.

Contact the [chairs](./committee) if you have any questions.
