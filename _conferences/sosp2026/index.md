title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0
---

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself:
software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on.
Based on the success of artifact evaluation for past editions, SOSP 2026 will have an artifact evaluation process.

The artifact evaluation process considers the reusability and reproducibility of artifacts associated with papers.
Artifact evaluation is _single blind_: authors do not know evaluators' identity, but evaluators know who the authors are.

## Process

Artifact evaluation is a cooperative process, unlike paper reviewing, meaning that authors have the opportunity to fix problems found during evaluation if they can do so in reasonable time.

1. Authors decide which [badges and associated checklists](./badges) they target.
2. Authors _register_ their artifact indicating which badges they target, along with the paper PDF and some metadata.
3. Authors then _submit_ their artifact, packaged according to [the artifact packaging guide](/packaging-guide).
4. Evaluators begin with a short "kick the tires" phase to double-check that the artifacts are complete and appear usable and contact authors if that is not the case.
5. Evaluators proceed with the main evaluation period, operating mostly independently but occasionally contacting authors if an issue arises.

**Submission site**: TBA


## Important Dates

- Acceptance notification to paper authors: **TBA**
- Artifact registration deadline: **TBA, 2026 (AoE)**
- Artifact submission deadline: **TBA, 2026 (AoE)**
- Early "kick the tires" evaluation period: **TBA**
- Main evaluation period: **TBA**
- Artifact decisions: **TBA**
- Camera-ready deadline: **TBA**

At least one author for each artifact submission must be reachable via email and respond to questions in a timely manner during the kick-the-tires period.
Ideally, authors should also be available to respond to reasonable requests during the main evaluation period.
