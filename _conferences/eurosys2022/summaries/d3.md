## Artifact contents

The artifact main component is Pylot, an autonomous vehicle simulator that we used to evaluate ERDOS. Moreover, the artifact contains scripts that compare ERDOS versus ROS, a widely used platform for autonomous vehicles, and Flink, a data-driven streaming system.

## Environment(s) used for testing

The evaluators used a machine provided by the authors for the evaluation. This machine had 2 x Xeon Gold 6226 CPUs, 128GB of RAM, and 2 x 24GB Titan-RTX GPUs running Linux Kernel 5.3.0.

## How the artifact supports the paper

The artifact supports all the paper's claims. More specifically, the evaluators were able to reproduce Figures that support claims C1, C2, C3 and C4 from the artifact's appendix. The results obtained during the evaluation of the artifact were generally the same from the ones reported in the paper. Executing all the experiments of the authors takes approximately a month. Therefore, the evaluators were not able to regenerate all the results needed to verify that the artifact supports C2, C3 and C4. However, the authors provided all the logs of their experiments. Therefore, the evaluators were, within the shorter timeframe available for the evaluation of the artifact, able to reproduce the related figures in the original paper and check that the artifact supports claims C2, C3 and C4.
