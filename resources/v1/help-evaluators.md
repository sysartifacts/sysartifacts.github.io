title: Help for evaluators

Start by reading the paper and writing down all claims it makes, through tables/figures or in text.
Then follow [the checklists](/badges) for each badge.

Most of the evaluation time should be spent _auditing_ the artifact itself to ensure it does what it should, not _debugging_ issues.
- If you encounter an issue you cannot solve through basic searches on Google/StackOverflow/..., talk to the authors about it.
- If the artifact seems too broken to be worth spending time on, submit a review already that does not grant the badges, and explicitly list the points the authors must fix to get the badges they want.

If the artifact requires accessing a remote machine through SSH, ensure you do not deanonymize yourself through the `user@host` part at the end of your public key (which you can remove entirely).
